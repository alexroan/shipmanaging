# Shipmanager (2012)

There are 3 applications of note which work together in this application (as far as I recall, 2012 was a long time ago). JavaDataEntry (Java), ProximityIndicator (C++) and ShipFinder (C). Check out Assignment 1.docx for an idea of how they're working together.

## Purpose of Application(s)

This application was written as part of second year Software Engineering module at Aberystwyth University, in 2012.
